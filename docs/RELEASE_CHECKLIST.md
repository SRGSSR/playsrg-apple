# Release notes html pages

The Play SRG iOS application has in `Profile` tab, `Settings` view, a `What's new` link.
It downloads a html file to display release notes. The html pages are published from the project github pages: [https://srgssr.github.io/playsrg-apple](https://srgssr.github.io/playsrg-apple).

`fastlane ios publishReleaseNotes` script does update automatically (recommended).

It can be done manually. No need to keep the commits history:

- Checkout `gh-pages` branch.
- Edit html files with new `div` for a new version.
- Add or remove the `preprod` div attribute if it's a prerelease version (see in the html script).
- Amend commit with changes.
- Force push the branch to remote.
- Switch to an other branch and remove local `gh-pages` branch (recommended).
