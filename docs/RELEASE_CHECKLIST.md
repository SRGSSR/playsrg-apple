# Release notes on Github pages

Play SRG iOS applications have in `Profile` tab, `Settings` view, a `What's new` link.
It downloads a html file to display release notes. The html pages are published on the project Github pages: [https://srgssr.github.io/playsrg-apple](https://srgssr.github.io/playsrg-apple).

The `fastlane ios publishReleaseNotes` script does update automatically (recommended).

It can be done manually, without keeping the commits history:

- Checkout `gh-pages` branch.
- Edit html files with a new `div` for a new version.
- Add or remove the `preprod` div attribute if it's a prerelease version (used by the javascript script).
- Amend commit with the changes.
- Force push the remote branch.
- Switch back to an other branch.
- Remove local `gh-pages` branch (recommended if the fastlane script needs to run later).
