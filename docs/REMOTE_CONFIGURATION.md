# Remote configuration

The proprietary project can be configured remotely using [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/). All primitive parameters (strings, numbers, booleans, JSON) from the `ApplicationConfiguration.json` file can be overridden. 

Some parameters are mandatory and others are optional. All applications are provided with a default configuration, available even when the Firebase service could not be queried (e.g. if no network connection is initially available).

## Behavior

If a parameter is overridden in the Firebase console, its value will be used, otherwise the local value will be used instead. If you want to disable an optional parameter for which a local value is available, you must therefore define an override for it in the Firebase console, providing no value.

The remote configuration has a validity of 15 minutes (30 seconds when debugging and in nightly builds), and is applied when the application wakes up from the background.

If a remote configuration is found to be invalid (usually a mandatory parameter is missing), the application will ignore it and continue with the previous valid configuration.

## Available parameters

A wide list of parameters are available. Some parameters support multiple comma-separated values.
