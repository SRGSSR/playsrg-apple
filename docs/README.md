## About

Play SRG is the [SRG SSR (Swiss Broadcasting Corporation)](https://www.srgssr.ch/en/who-we-are/organisation/) audio and video platform, provided as a distinct service for each of its business units ([RSI](https://www.rsi.ch), [RTR](https://www.rtr.ch), [RTS](https://www.rts.ch), [SRF](https://www.srf.ch) and [SWI](https://www.swissinfo.ch)). This repository contains the source code of the Play SRG application for iOS.

The Play platform is more generally accessible on the web and on Android phones:

## Features

The iOS application has a rich set of functionalities, among which:

* Access to to our content, whether its is broadcast on TV, radio or online. 
* An audio mini player.
* Subscriptions with push notifications.
* Resume playback and continuous playback.
* Favorites and downloads.
* AirPlay and Google Cast support.
* VoiceOver and larger font support for better accessibility.
* Handoff support.

Depending on the business unit, some functionalities might not be available (e.g. SWI has no associated radio channel).

## Compatibility

The project runs on iOS 12 and above and must be opened with the latest Xcode version.

## Contributing

If you want to contribute to the project, have a look at our [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Required tools

Building the project requires command-line tools for icon generation, easily installed with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):
	
	brew install imagemagick ghostscript
	brew install jq
	
Project dependencies are retrieved using both [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) and [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/). Be sure that these tools are available on your system.

## Building the project

A [Makefile](../Makefile) provides several targets to prepare project dependencies. The available targets can be listed by running the following command from the project root folder:

```
make help
```

Commands are available both for internal use (proprietary builds) and for wider use (public builds).

### Proprietary builds

Dependencies must be updated and built first:

```
make bootstrap
```

Then open Xcode to build and run the project.

Private project settings (keys, tokens, etc.) are stored [in a private repository](https://github.com/SRGSSR/playsrg-configuration-ios), pulled under the `Configuration` directory when running `make setup` (or any other target depending on it). The SHA-1 of the configuration commit which is used is explicitly provided in the `Makefile`. Settings are therefore versioned alongside the project, providing for reproducible builds.

If you need to make changes to the settings:

1. Perform the required changes in the `Configuration` directory (and in the project as well if needed).
1. Switch to the `Configuration` directory and commit changes there.
1. Update the [Makefile](../Makefile) `CONFIGURATION_COMMIT_SHA1` variable to point at the configuration commit to use.
1. Push all commits when you are ready.

### Public builds

Dependencies must be updated and built first:

```
make public.bootstrap
```

Then open Xcode to build and run the project.

Public builds differ from proprietary builds in a few areas:

* Some content cannot be played (e.g. TV livestreams or series).
* Analytics are not collected.
* Push notifications are not setup.
* Remote configuration is disabled.

## Releasing binaries

The proprietary project uses [fastlane](https://fastlane.tools/) for releasing binaries (either for internal builds or for the AppStore).
