## Contributing

If you want to contribute to the project, have a look at our [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Required tools

Building the project requires command-line tools for icon generation, easily installed with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):
	
	brew install imagemagick ghostscript
	brew install jq
	
Some project dependencies are retrieved using [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) and [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/). Be sure that these tools are available on your system.

## Building the project

A [Makefile](../Makefile) provides several targets to prepare project dependencies. The available targets can be listed by running the following command from the project root folder:

```
make help
```

Commands are available both for internal use (proprietary builds) and for wider use (public builds).

### Private settings

Private project settings (keys, tokens, etc.) are stored [in a private repository](https://github.com/SRGSSR/playsrg-configuration-ios), pulled under the `Configuration` directory when running `make setup` (or any other target depending on it). The SHA-1 of the configuration commit which is used is explicitly provided in the `Makefile`. Settings are therefore versioned alongside the project, providing for reproducible builds.

If you need to make changes to the settings:

1. Perform the required changes in the `Configuration` directory (and in the project as well if needed).
1. Switch to the `Configuration` directory and commit changes there.
1. Update the [Makefile](../Makefile) `CONFIGURATION_COMMIT_SHA1` variable to point at the configuration commit to use.
1. Push all commits when you are ready.

If you are part of the SRG SSR organization be sure to setup the project first:

```
make setup
```

### Running the project

Dependencies must retrieve and built first:

```
make bootstrap
```

Then open Xcode to build and run the project.

## Releasing binaries

The proprietary project uses [fastlane](https://fastlane.tools/) for releasing binaries, either for internal purposes or for the AppStore.
